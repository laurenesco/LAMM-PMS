# LAMM-PMS
The LAMM Property Management System (PMS) is a robust PMS focused on allowing businesses to manage their employees, customers, locations, reservations, transactions, and more on one centralized platform. This application aims to facilitate successful management of all aspects of property management businesses. Further, the application can be extended to cater to any service which offers reservations, allowing them to consolidate all of their business management needs.

This project is written in C#, utlizing the .NET framework using Windows Forms.
